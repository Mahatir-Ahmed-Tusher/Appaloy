# Appaloy

It is a platform which is an alternative of Google Play Store. Most of my apps were built to solve my own everyday problems. Over time, I realized I needed a single platform where I could access all my creations from anywhere in the world and easily share them with others. Appaloy was born from that vision—a personal hub that doubles as a gateway for anyone who wants to explore and use these apps.
